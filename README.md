# aries-vdri-peer

This repo is not yet in active use. It was intended to hold code that exposes [peer DIDs](https://openssi.github.io/peer-did-method-spec/) as an [Aries VDRI](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vdri) plugin. However, we are currently bundling peer DID support into the core VDRI component. Unless/until that changes, ignore this repo.
